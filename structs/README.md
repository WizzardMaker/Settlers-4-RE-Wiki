# Introduction
This is a collection of all the various classes and structures found in the Settlers 4 binaries.

Help is gladly appreciated and all information is more or less just based on educated guesses during reverse engineering.
The main purpose is to help other reverse engineers and to collect as much data about S4 as possible.

## Categories
To somewhat structure all those classes, they are sorted into different categories.
The categories are defined by the classes origin in the Gold Edition (The "splitting" into different `.dll` files dictates a rough layout) or by it's type (e.g. AI related classes belong to the AI category)
